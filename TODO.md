# TODO (features I want to add)
- [_] Store data in local file system (need to figure out which directories to bind mount, I already am bind mounting /data/media, but that's not enough)
- [_] Allow to specify a source folder where all the media is
- [_] Not have to create a copy of the media files (mp3, vtt, etc.), but rather leave them where they are
- [_] Modify transcriptions in the UI and save them to the transcription file (need to figure out which transcription file is being used - vtt, srt, etc.)
